# Modal ( React.js Mini Project )
With the help of semantic UI, I created a very cool and fully responsive modal. In the form of a Reect file, it is actually the same as JSX. This file was supposed to be a practice file, but Yahoo turned out to be a very cool and funny mini-project.
## Run Project

To run this cool mini project on port 300 or any port, run the following command ...
#### ` $ npm start`
